# Projects
A compilation of all of my projects I have worked on.


## PenPal
This project was my capstone project for my senior year at Appalachian State. The idea behind it was to design a web app that would pair people with others who share their interests to become pen pals. Users could choose either to use their emails to communicate with penpals, or do it in a more traditional method by writing letters. My primary focus in this project was the client-side portion, and designing the use cases.

## PhaserDev
This was one of several research projects that I worked on throughout undergrad as part of the S-STEM program. My group and I utilized Javascript and the Phaser API to design a Super Mario-esque platform game where the goal was to collect the key in each room to move on to the next one. This was one of my favorite projects, as it combined two of my favorite parts of programming - web development, and game development. 

## Sstemdatabase
This is another research project done for the S-STEM program, and the focus of this one was to build a website that hosted information about music and their beats per minute (BPM). The idea was that the user could search for a specific BPM they needed (perhaps as a DJ trying to find songs of similar tempos to mix together), and a list would come up of all songs that were at that BPM, and have links to audios of the songs as well. 

## UnrealRepo
Another research project, this one was primarily focused on learning how to code in Unreal Engine using just C/C++ and designing a web-page that gives a tutorial of how to do the basics that we learned in Unreal Engine. 

## amplifyapp
This was an example project that I was following from a Udemy course, to learn how to code in React JS for the PenPal project. It taught me a lot about React and the various things that can be done with it, and how far client-side programming has come in recent years.


### Not included in this repo
There are two more projects that I worked on that have not been included in this repo due to the size of the projects being too great. The first is the AppTAG project - this was a project I did as a Student Research Assistant for the school, as the CS department had been tasked by the Accounting department to design a fun web-game to teach students some Accounting basics and give them a fun way to practice these basics. This was my first introduction to Phaser, and I grew much more comfortable in Javascript than I had been before working on this project. The other is the Steminar-Duck-Game - another research project for S-STEM using Unreal Engine, except this time the focus was to create a demo of a game using the tools that Unreal Engine gives the user. We decided on a first person horror-esque game that took place in our actual class building, where the antagonist was a giant duck that tries to find and attack the player. This was another favorite project of mine, as I mainly designed the HUD for the player, and really enjoyed working on a game that was not a web-app and was actually playable.
